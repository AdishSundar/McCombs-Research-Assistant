Assisting McCombs professors with their research project comparing reputable journals between the fields of Management and Finance

From the Spring of 2023 to now, I have worked with Professors Laura Starks and Janet Dukerich on their research project. 
This project looks at how various journals at have accepted submissions over the past three decades. The professors had concerns that the journals could potentially have biases within their selection process of certain articles. For example, the affiliations of authors, such as whether or not they went to a top research institution, could potentially impact the likelihood of an article being published, rather than only taking into consideration the quality of the article. In this repository, I explore this through Python using multiple different regressions and statistical modeling/analysis.
